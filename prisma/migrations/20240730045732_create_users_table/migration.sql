  Warnings:

  - The primary key for the `users` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - You are about to drop the column `id` on the `users` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - Made the column `name` on table `users` required. This step will fail if there are existing NULL values in that column.
